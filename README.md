# Project Title
DumbDumb: Your Semi-Smart Crypto Advisor
# What is this?
An application that will scan the web for on-chain, social sentiment, and algorithmic predictors of price moves for all cryptocurrencies listed on the big exchanges and provide user with this data in an accessible form for further research
## What is the need?
Are you a student in one of the most expensive universities in the United States living in one of the most expensive cities in the United States? 
(Don't even answer, I know you are crying inside) 
Are you busy with your schoolwork, research and internships and barely have time to spend with friend's let alone research profitable market moves?
(I know I am, haven't visited my minecraft server in weeks)
Wouldn't it be nice if you not only satisfied your Agile requirement, but also created a shortcut to money making that will do all the due diligence for you and present you only the best trades, All you have to do is confirm, execute, and profit!
(Disclaimer time I have no idea if it will actually work but statistically we will probably somewhat succeed. Also: Not a Financial Advisor)
### How will this be done?
We will use [CoinMarketCap API](https://github.com/barnumbirr/coinmarketcap) for all algorithmic and on chain data and [Santiment API] for all the public sentiment data. We will also be blatantly borrowing (with citation) different analysis algorithms so we can give estimates of the probability of upsides and downsides of different coins and present it to the user. Additionally we will train a few neural nets on the past data to give us the power of machine learning that will be able to synthesize multitudes of algorithms into its own prediction.
#### Scope
As the majority of the code for all the steps has already been created (APIs, algorithms, and neural nets) our job will be to make them work together and create a comfortable user experience, which for a team of 4-5 people is more than doable.
##### Disclaimer
Still not a Financial Advisor
We will be testing it with past data and mock investments, and as I expect it to be profitable I would love to give DumbDumb some of my own money to trade with and maybe include those results in the final presentation.
